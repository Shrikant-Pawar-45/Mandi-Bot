## Deployment

You can deploy this app to GitHub and Streamlit Community Cloud (free) quickly. Below are the recommended steps.

1. Create a Git repository and push

```powershell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - MandiBot"
# Create a repository on GitHub, then push (replace <remote-url>)
git remote add origin <remote-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

2. Enable GitHub Actions (CI)

The repo contains a sample GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/python-app.yml` that installs dependencies and runs `test_api.py` on push.

3. Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud

- Go to https://share.streamlit.io and sign in with GitHub.
- Click "New app" and select your repository and branch (`main`).
- Set the main file to `app.py` and the Python version to 3.12 if prompted.
- Click "Deploy". Streamlit will install packages from `requirements.txt`.

Notes:
- Keep any secrets (API keys) out of the repo. Use Streamlit's Secrets manager (`.streamlit/secrets.toml` locally ‚Äî do NOT commit it). In Streamlit Cloud, set secrets via the app settings.
- If Streamlit fails to install `sentence-transformers` or `tensorflow` due to heavy dependencies, consider using a lighter embedding approach or hosting a separate embeddings microservice.

4. Alternative: Deploy to Heroku / Railway / Render

The included `Procfile` and `runtime.txt` make it compatible with Heroku-like PaaS. Streamlit Community Cloud is the most straightforward option for quick demos.

That's it ‚Äî once connected, your app will auto-deploy on pushes to the configured branch.
